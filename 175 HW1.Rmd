```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



```{r cars}
Data1 <- read.table("vets.txt")
colnames(Data1) <- c("Vet.time","Vet.cns")

library(survival)
vet.Surv <- Surv(Data1$Vet.time)
print(vet.Surv)
mean(Data1[,1])# Vet.surv == Vet.time

```
b/c data may be censored

```{r}
sum(Data1$Vet.cns)
sum(Data1$Vet.time*Data1$Vet.cns)

mean(vet.Surv)

```

it shows total amount of time that people did finish the study aka not-censored

Surv function is to help distinguish the use of 0/1 or 1/2 of event occurrence.

```{r}
retire <- read.table("retire.txt", header=TRUE,skip=2)

```

```{r}
library(survival)
ret.surv <- Surv(retire$time)
sfit <- survfit(ret.surv ~ 1)
plot(sfit,xlab = "time",ylab = "Survival probablity")

```
```{r}
summary(sfit)
```
In first 50 month ,survival probability is pretty high, at least greater than 65% 
But the probability is steadlly decreasing
